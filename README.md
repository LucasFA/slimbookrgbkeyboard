Here is a [link](https://slimbook.es/en/tutoriales/aplicaciones-slimbook/501-en-slimbook-rgb-keyboard-3-0) to the app tutorial!

Also, if you'd like to customize the light you can find a template inside the foder src/animations, you just need to change the RGB values and save the file inside your local SlimbookRGB animation folder wich is in this path "/usr/share/slimbookrgbkeyboard/src/animations". You will probably have to do it from your terminal as root user.
